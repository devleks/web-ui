This project builds upon the foundation of the [browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use), which is designed to make websites accessible for AI agents.

We would like to officially thank [WarmShao](https://github.com/warmshao) for his contribution to this project.

**WebUI:** is built on Gradio and supports a most of `browser-use` functionalities. This UI is designed to be user-friendly and enables easy interaction with the browser agent.

**Expanded LLM Support:** We've integrated support for various Large Language Models (LLMs), including: Gemini, OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Ollama etc. And we plan to add support for even more models in the future.

**Custom Browser Support:** You can use your own browser with our tool, eliminating the need to re-login to sites or deal with other authentication challenges. This feature also supports high-definition screen recording.

## Installation Guide

Read the [quickstart guide](https://docs.browser-use.com/quickstart#prepare-the-environment) or follow the steps below to get started.

> Python 3.11 or higher is required.

First, we recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to setup the Python environment.

```bash
uv venv --python 3.11
```

and activate it with:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then install playwright:

```bash
playwright install
```

## Usage

1.  **Run the WebUI:**
    ```bash
    python webui.py --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 7788
    ```
2.  **Access the WebUI:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:7788`.
3.  **Using Your Own Browser:**
    - Close all chrome windows
    - Open the WebUI in a non-Chrome browser, such as Firefox or Edge. This is important because the persistent browser context will use the Chrome data when running the agent.
    - Check the "Use Own Browser" option within the Browser Settings.

## (Optional) Configure Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your environment variables, including API keys for the LLM. With

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**If using your own browser:** - Set `CHROME_PATH` to the executable path of your browser and `CHROME_USER_DATA` to the user data directory of your browser.

You can just copy examples down below to your `.env` file.

### Windows

```env
CHROME_PATH="C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"
CHROME_USER_DATA="C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data"
```

> Note: Replace `YourUsername` with your actual Windows username for Windows systems.

### Mac

```env
CHROME_PATH="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"
CHROME_USER_DATA="~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Profile 1"
```

## Changelog
